Things I Should Do Soon:

Short-term ideas:
- Add gooch shading. As Material in scene pass? Maybe entire shader?
- Draw some voronoi diagrams on canvas Fbo
- Improve outline filter AA by rendering edges with MSAA.
- Fix memory access rendering bug when maximizing window
  - May have crept in when using Fbo for swaps? -> nope.
- Reconsider when we set image and buffer infos
- Add hand forward offset
- Adjust position of in-swing step if velocity changes significantly
- Make prettier
  - Add scene selector
  - Setup cube map BG
  - Setup blinn-phong rendering
- Use obj materials info to allow multiple materials per "model"
- Catmull rom splines

Medium-term ideas:
- Fix Mac build
- Try doing PBR rendering
- Setup a compute shader

Long-term ideas:
- Physics
