Things I Should Do Soon:

Short-term ideas:
- Better way to describe animations
  - Non-linear interpolation
  - Full splines with more than two points
  - Object hierarchy to animate within object space
- Allow models with vertex data not loaded from obj file
- Setup follow camera, that follows around a moving target
- Convert objects to consistent scale, in centimetres
- Make prettier
  - Setup cube map BG
  - Setup blinn-phong rendering
- Use obj materials info to allow multiple materials per "model"
- Render triangle fractal code

Medium-term ideas: 
- Try doing PBR rendering
- Setup a compute shader
- Setup IK bone system

Long-term ideas:
- Procedural animation
- Physics?
