Things I Should Do Soon:

Short-term ideas:
- Render objects with different textures
  - Get another model to render
  - Multiple ways this could be done
  - Create a DesccriptorSet for each texture
  - bind that texture descriptor set per model/material

Medium-term ideas:
- Setup imgui
- Setup a compute shader
- Setup blinn-phong rendering
- Better way to describe animations

Long-term ideas:
- Setup cube map BG
- Try doing PBR rendering
- Procedural animation
- Physics?
